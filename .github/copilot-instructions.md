We are building a web app with Convex, Next.js, and Convex Auth. This app is designed to be a full-stack application that leverages Convex for backend services, Next.js for frontend development, and Convex Auth for user authentication.

The app is called Pockets, and it is a personal finance management tool that helps users track their expenses, manage budgets, and gain insights into their financial habits.

Pockets is primarily designed for couples who want to manage their finances together, allowing them to share budgets, track expenses, and collaborate on financial goals but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.

The app is built using the following technologies:

- **Convex**: A serverless backend that provides a real-time database and server logic
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-rendered applications with routing and optimized performance
- **Convex Auth**: A library for handling user authentication and authorization in Convex

The app is structured to provide a seamless user experience, with a focus on intuitive navigation and responsive design. It includes features such as:

- User registration and login
- Expense tracking and categorization
- Budget management
- Financial insights and reports

- Collaborative features for couples to manage finances together
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Integration with Convex Auth for secure user authentication
- A clean and modern UI built with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates and synchronization of data across devices
- A focus on simplicity and ease of use for users of all financial backgrounds

The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear navigation and intuitive controls. The app aims to provide a comprehensive solution for personal finance management while maintaining a focus on simplicity and ease of use.
